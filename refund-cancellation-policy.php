                    1. Refund Eligibility:<br>

                    2. Understanding Course Content:<br>
                    We encourage all users to thoroughly explore the course details, curriculum, and instructor information before making a purchase. It is essential to ensure that the course aligns with your learning goals and expectations.<br><br>

                    3. Technical Issues:<br>

We'll do our best to address your concerns and improve our offerings continually.<br><br>

                    5. Changes to Course Content:<br>
                    While we make every effort to maintain course content and accessibility, there might be occasions where updates or changes are necessary. Rest assured, any updates to course content will be made available to you without any additional charges.<br><br>

                    6. Exceptions:<br>
                    As mentioned earlier, the only exceptions for a refund would be those required by law. In such cases, we will abide by the relevant regulations and process the refund accordingly.<br><br>

                    7. Contact Us:<br>
                    If you have any questions or require further clarification about our refund policy, please feel free to contact our customer support team at [support email/phone number]. Our team will be glad to assist you with any inquiries you may have.<br><br>
